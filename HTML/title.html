    <h1><em>The Minimalist Web:</em> Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>
    <p class="author-info">By <strong>Alex Parker</strong> | Published: August 15, 2025</p>
    <p>
        In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations, heavy scripts, and high-resolution images, 
        the art of building a <em>pure, lightweight</em> webpage is nearly forgotten. 
        This article explores the charm and power of HTML’s 
        <mark>simplest tags</mark>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p>
        Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than plain text, sprinkled with 
        <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> styles. The focus was on the 
        <strong>content</strong>, not the decoration. In many ways, this was the 
        <em>golden age</em> of readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <u>HTML</u> language itself was designed for structure — headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning. 
        E = mc<sup>2</sup> still looks good without a single pixel of CSS, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clear as ever.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>
        There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, readers focus on the words. 
        “Minimalism is not the lack of something, it’s the perfect amount of something,” as a famous designer once said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the 
        <s>chaotic</s> <u>simpler</u> internet days.
    </p>

    <h2>Magazine-Style Sections</h2>
    <p>
        Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with <u>bold headings</u> and subtle separators. 
        Think of <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> as the thin line between chapters, and headings as your section titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can even keep a “side note” feel with <span class="small-text">smaller text</span> for author comments or additional reading hints.
    </p>

    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: Mix 250g of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth. 
        Step 2: Heat at 180<sup>°</sup>C for 30 minutes. 
        Step 3: <s>Serve cold</s> <u>Serve warm</u> for best taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code snippet: <code>temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</code>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>
        Stripping a webpage down to its <b>bare essentials</b> is not just a design choice — it’s a statement. 
        It says: “The words matter more than the wrapping.”
    </p>
    <p>
        So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page with nothing but 
        <em>headings, paragraphs, and text formatting</em>. 
        You might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.
